# CYCLISTIC - BIKE SHARE COMPANY

**Google Data Analytics - Cyclistic Bike share**

**CAPSTONE PROJECT:**

**TOOLS USED - SQL(Bigquery), Excel, Google cloud storage and Data Studio, Powerpoint Presentation** 

The project in a Marketing Analyst team for a Fictional Bike share company called Cyclistic. In cyclistic, there are two different type of users a.Casual rider and b.Members. 
Members  have annual subcriptions where the casual riders don't. Also,Lily Morelo-Marketing executive team suggests that the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual membershiip

**1. The Business Task:**

a. To identify how the casual riders and members use the ride share service differently
b. Marketing strategy to convert the casual riders to members.
Insights lead to the understanding of how the casual riders and the annual members use the cyclistic bikes differently, this can in turn be used to develop marketing strategies to convert the casual riders to annual members.

**2. A description of the data source used:**

Data Location: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

Public dataset. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under the license: https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement

Due to privacy reasons, one cannot determine the location in which the casual riders live, whether it is near the service area or somewhere else. Cannot determine if they have purchased the pass multiple times.

ROCCC â€“ Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, Cited

Data is credible, as it is accurate, data can be used to arrive to informed data driven decision making aimed at solving the business problem defined above.

**3. Cleaning and manipulation of data in excel:**

i. Dowloaded the last 12 months of data from the link mentioned above in data source section and extracted them into a folder.

ii. For each excel, added the column 'day_of_the_week' - which says in which day the ride has been started. used the function **'=weekday(column)'** in excel.

iii. For each excel, added a column 'month' to determine whether the data belongs to the month as each excel belongs to one month. used the function **'=month(started_at)'** in excel. Here there is a strong assumption, although the ride started in one month and prolonged to the next month,only the start time is considered.

iv. For each excel, added the column 'date-difference' to determine if there is some error in the data. used the formula **'=ended_at-started_at'**. For instance, the started_at is 12/03/2021 and the ended_at is 10/02/2021. Therefore, this column allowed us to see if there is any negative value potraying such flaws in data. Fortunately, there was not any. 

v. Exported the excel folders to google cloud storage, as the file size was huge to be imported from local computer while using bigquery(sql).

**4. Analysis and Insight generation in bigquery(sql):**

i. Created a new project called 'cyclistic-chicago-data'.

ii. Created a new dataset under the above project with the name 'cyclistic_data'.

iii. Imported all the twelve months table from the google cloud storage, stored them under the 'cyclistic-data' dataset.

iv. After importing all the tables, combined all the tables vertically under the same column name without any duplicate data using the function 'UNION DISTINCT'

**The query:**

select *
from `cyclistic-chicago-data.cyclistic_data.january_month`
union distinct 
select *
from `cyclistic-chicago-data.cyclistic_data.february_month`
union distinct 
select *
from `cyclistic-chicago-data.cyclistic_data.march_month`
union distinct 
select *
from `cyclistic-chicago-data.cyclistic_data.april_month`
union distinct 
select *
from `cyclistic-chicago-data.cyclistic_data.may_month`
union distinct 
select *
from `cyclistic-chicago-data.cyclistic_data.june_month`
union distinct 
select *
from `cyclistic-chicago-data.cyclistic_data.july_month`
union distinct 
select *
from `cyclistic-chicago-data.cyclistic_data.august_month`
union distinct 
select *
from `cyclistic-chicago-data.cyclistic_data.september_month`
union distinct 
select *
from `cyclistic-chicago-data.cyclistic_data.october_month`
union distinct
select *
from `cyclistic-chicago-data.cyclistic_data.november_month`
union distinct
select *
from `cyclistic-chicago-data.cyclistic_data.december_month`

all the tables are combined using the above query, and the resulting table is exported into a new bigquery table using the name 'year_2021' for further querying.

v. To determing, the time each rider has spent in minutes during the ride, and to record them in a separate column, the following query was used,

**The query:**

SELECT *,
 DATETIME_DIFF(ended_at,started_at, minute) AS difference
 FROM `cyclistic-chicago-data.cyclistic_data.year_2021'
 
 and to identify, whether the query has been performed correctly, random checks performed using the following,
 
**The query:**
 
SELECT started_at,ended_at,ride_id
FROM `cyclistic-chicago-data.cyclistic_data.year_2021`
WHERE ride_id='3EC1B5A4D4B9AB99'

vi. The cases with time difference is negative indicating that the end time is before the start time, and to remove those outliers,

**The query:**

SELECT * FROM `cyclistic-chicago-data.cyclistic_data.difference_in_minutes` 
WHERE difference < 0

and there was one ride with a negative value, and that row of data has been eliminated, the ride_id is '3EC1B5A4D4B9AB99'.

vii. To understand the average and the maximum distance travelled by each type of rider, the following query has been used,

**The query (casual riders):**

SELECT max(difference) AS maximum_casual_ridelength,
avg(difference) AS average_casual_ridelength
FROM `cyclistic-chicago-data.cyclistic_data.difference_in_minutes` 
WHERE member_casual='casual'

**The query (member riders):**

SELECT max(difference) AS maximum_member_ridelength,
avg(difference) AS average_member_ridelength
FROM `cyclistic-chicago-data.cyclistic_data.difference_in_minutes` 
WHERE member_casual='member'

viii. To understand the type of ride used by each type of rider, the following query has been used,

**The query:**

SELECT COUNT(rideable_type),rideable_type,member_casual
FROM `cyclistic-chicago-data.cyclistic_data.year_2021`
GROUP BY rideable_type, member_casual

**5. Supporting visualizations:**

To generate visualization and create the dashboard, "google data studio, excel and powerpoint" was used,

**Dashboard**
![Dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101074709/157043796-eeca7552-39f6-41e1-821a-c5687dbfe468.jpg)

**6. Key findings from the visualization of data:**

a. From Record count and Duration in minutes pie charts, Member riders has more number of rides (55%) than the casual riders (45%), but the total time spent by Member riders is only 34%, whereas the casual riders spent 66% of their time. It shows that the casual riders use it for a long duration whereas the member riders use more frequently.

b. To add on the first result, ride length in minutes table shows the same, the average ride length of casual riders is 32 minutes, whereas for members it is 13.6 minutes. The maximum ride length in the same table indicates the maximum ride length for casual riders is 55944 minutes which is approximately 38 days and for the member riders it is 1560 minutes. This evidence shows that member riders use the bikes more frequently.

c. From day vs number of rides bar graph, it is clear that casual riders has more rides during weekends (saturday and sunday), whereas for member riders it is more and consistent during weekdays.

d. From number of rides by month line graph, it is evident that, people use the bikes more during July, august, september and october months compared to other months.

e. From rideable type bar graph, we can understand that docked bikes are not used to member riders, whereas casual riders use them more.

**7. Recommendations:**

a. It is not true that the company's success depends on annual membership users, as it is clear that casual users contribute to more ridelength compared to member riders. So should concentrate on marketing, improving offers and attract casual riders too.

b. Weekend memberships and marketing to people who are interested more in cycling activities can improve the profit, as not only the office goers but also the fun lovers are using the bikeshare services.
